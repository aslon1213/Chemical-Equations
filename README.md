# Chemical-Equations
Solving Chemical Equations with differentials
This is a Python program that balances chemical equations using the differential equations, plus plots a graph using Euler's method.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have a python(version 3) installed on your machine. 


Step by step installation process:
1. You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```Git:
git clone https://github.com/aslon1213/Chemical-Equations.git
```
2. Create a new virtual environment for python using pipenv
#if you don't have pipenv install already, install it using | ```pip install pipenv```
```
python -m pipenv shell
```
or 
```
